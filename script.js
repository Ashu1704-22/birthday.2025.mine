        "college outside.jpg": "🎓 Her university days… the time when we both found little moments to talk with each other ⏳💬. I know, whenever she misses me, she gets a little upset 💔🥺.

        "college trip.jpg": "💭 This is a day I'll never forget… 🌅 She was away on a college trip 🎒, in a place completely out of network coverage 📵. I was restless 😟, worried 💔, waiting ⏳.

It feels like she always knows my heart 💖, always knows my reactions 💭😊 before I even say a word 💕🌌.",
        "flower bush.jpg": "🌸 In that flower shop, she held the bouquet like a queen of blossoms 👑💐 — yet even the flowers looked shy before her beauty ❤️. Perfect — because the truest flower was never in the vase, but standing before me, smiling like she owned the spring itself 🌷✨.",
        "ghanteswari.jpg": "🌊 This place holds the treasure of our love 💖 — moments etched in time, where the world felt still. The way I held her hand as we walked through the flowing waters 🤝, guiding her gently past stones and slippery paths 🌿, protecting her like she was my whole world.

At that moment, love wasn't just a feeling — it was a blessing. ✨💫.",
        "gussa on late.jpg": "At this point of time, she is a little bit angry 😅, yet smiling 😊 just to make me feel comfortable and keep me calm 💖. Her care shines even through her frustration ✨, and it makes my heart melt every time 💓.",

        "hirakud dam.jpg": "📸 She loves photoshoots in every little moment of life 🌸. And me? I'm her forever photographer 💕 — capturing her smile, her gestures, her existence, so I never miss even a second of her magic ✨. She was born to be a model, a muse of beauty and grace 💖, but destiny placed her in studies 📚. Still, I only wish that every dream she carries finds its way to her 🌟, because she deserves nothing less than everything 💕. Her beautiful soul deserves all the love, success, and happiness this world can give 💫.",
        "hirakud garrden.jpg": "✨ This time, with me and my friends, she plays with the whole environment 🌿, her smiling face spreading joy everywhere 😊💫 — and yes, making them a little jealous too 😉. Here, she even tries to look taller than me 😅, and honestly, she's just so adorable 💖. It's moments like these that make me fall even deeper in love with her, without even realizing it. ❤️",
        "khiri eat.jpg": "✨ Isme kuch aisa hai jo mujhe andar se pata hai… chahe 36 ke 36 gun mile ya na mile, par yeh ek gun sab kuch cover kar lega — FOODIE WALI QUALITY 🍽️💖. Aur wo bhi bina kisi hesitation ke! I know she loves her make-up 💄, but when it comes to food — sab jaaye bhaad mein 😅, hum toh chale khane! 🥰 Uski muskaan tab aur bhi pyaari lagti hai jab woh apne favourite khane ke saath hoti hai ✨.",
        "kiit intern.jpg": "After so much work at the hospital for her internship 🏥, she throws all her tiredness out the window 🌬️ and calls me with that smiling, heartwarming face 😊❤️ — just to make me feel better and wash away all my fatigue 💖. I think that's what love truly looks like — in every small effort and caring gesture ✨.",
        "last meet.jpg": "It makes me wonder… how far can she go for me? 💕 After a night-long journey 🚆, eyes heavy with sleep 😌 and body aching with fatigue, she still came all the way here ✨ just to spend a few precious moments with me 💑… and that beautiful smile on her face 😍 ohhhhhh, it's a sight I'll never forget.",
        "pink saree 1.jpg": "✨ This is the place where time stands still ⏳, and the reason why I admire and cherish her so, so, so much 💖. I know black suits her perfectly, but in pink she is simply stunning 🌸. I still remember the day I first saw this picture — I was astonished, forgetting everything else around me, lost completely in her beauty ✨.",
        "pink saree 2.jpg": "This explains how beauty and brains can coexist within a girl ✨. Yet sometimes, it also includes a touch of rowdy boldness 💥 — especially for those miscreants who try to act oversmart with her.",
        "samaleswari night.jpg": "✨ I don't know if she smiles so much because of me, or if it's just her nature to be a happy soul 😊💖. That night, breaking hostel rules, she stepped out with me 🌙 — a simple act, yet it spoke volumes of the trust she has in me 💫. From that moment, I promised myself… never to break that trust, no matter the cost, no matter the situation 🤍.",
        "sambal pur zoo.jpg": "💫 This picture captures her cuteness — a charm with no boundaries 🌸. At the zoo 🦁🐒, where even the parrots 🦜 and butterflies 🦋 seemed to pause and stare, she wore the very dress I first fell for. In that moment, I couldn't resist taking a photo 📸. I asked her for a mischievous pose 😏💕 — and she gave me one that still makes my heart glow every time.",
        "Saree.jpg": "Since the beginning of our friendship 💕, this has been the photo I cherish most 📸. I told her that, as a small girl 🌸, this saree crowns her with an everlasting title ✨ — “Gorgeous”, one that time could never take away.",
        "Screenshot_2024-02-29-16-49-53-22_1c337646f29875672b5a61192b9010f9.jpg": "That very first photo of her 💖 — the moment I saw it, she found a special place in my heart 💓. Every time I look at it, I'm reminded of just how extremely lovable she is 🌸, and how effortlessly she captured my soul ✨.",
        "temple.jpg": "Here she seems to say, “Hey sun ☀️, don’t pour all your brightness on me — save some for yourself, for I shine brighter than you ✨. My light can warm and brighten the lives of my loved ones for a lifetime 💖.”",
        "yellow kurti.jpg": "Her smile, paired with that yellow dress 💛, makes her so irresistibly attractive that even the Black-hooded Oriole 🐦 seems jealous. But she, as always, remains carefree, confident, and calm — a poise that truly defines her aura ✨.."
